# project: mondrianMosaic

Experiment with generating mondrian-type mosaic or maybe some kind of pinterest wall. Just using JS

# ToDo

- [X] fast cleaning in JS
- [X] install babel and transpile it
- [X] minify it
- [ ] ...maybe think about optimizing and new edition (this time with dogs for example)?
